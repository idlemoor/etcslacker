# Heresy Tools for Slackware

The heresy tools are add-ons for slackpkg that simplify maintenance of your
Slackware system. Some people will think that these tools are against the
philosophy of Slackware, hence the name 'heresy'.

* heresy_etc -- maintain your config files
* heresy_unattended -- automatically apply updates
* heresy_rollback -- revert a package update
* heresy_installdeps -- automatically install dependencies
